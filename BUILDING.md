## Platforms

We do not recommend Windows for rippled production use at this time. Currently,
the Ubuntu platform has received the highest level of quality assurance,
testing, and support. Additionally, 32-bit Windows versions are not supported.


## Prerequisites

To build this package, you will need to install [Conan][] and [CMake][] (>=
3.16).

[Conan]: https://conan.io/downloads.html
[CMake]: https://cmake.org/download/

Linux developers will commonly have a default [Conan profile][1] that compiles
with GCC and links with libstdc++.
You can check your default profile with `conan profile show default`.
(If you have not yet generated a default profile, then you can with `conan
profile new default --detect`.)

If you are linking with libstdc++ (see profile setting `compiler.libcxx`),
then you will need to choose a Conan profile with the `libstdc++11` ABI.
The easiest way is to change your default profile to use it like this:

```
conan profile update settings.compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11 default
```

Windows developers will commonly have a default Conan profile that is missing
a selection for the [runtime library][2].
We recommend that you make that selection in your Conan profile to ensure
a consistent choice among all packages.

```
conan profile update settings.compiler.runtime=MT default
```


## Branches

For a stable release, choose the `master` branch or one of the tagged releases
listed on [rippled's GitHub page](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/releases).

```
git checkout master
```

To test the latest release candidate, choose the `release` branch.

```
git checkout release
```

If you are contributing or want the latest set of untested features,
then use the `develop` branch instead.

```
git checkout develop
```


## How to build

Here is an example building the package in a release configuration.
These commands should work from just about any shell,
including Bash and PowerShell.

```
conan export external/rocksdb
mkdir .build
cd .build
conan install .. --build missing
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan_toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build . --config Release
./rippled --help
```

In addition to choosing a different configuration, there are a few options you
can pass to the CMake configure command.
In particular, the `unity` option allows you to select between the unity and
non-unity builds. Unity builds may be faster to compile (at the cost of much
more memory) since they combine multiple sources into a single compiliation
unit - this is the default if you don't specify. Non-unity builds can be
helpful for detecting `#include` omissions or for finding other build-related
issues, but aren't generally needed for testing and running.

- `-Dunity=ON` to enable/disable unity builds (defaults to ON)
- `-Dassert=ON` to enable asserts
- `-Djemalloc=ON` to enable jemalloc support for heap checking
- `-Dsan=thread` to enable the thread sanitizer with clang
- `-Dsan=address` to enable the address sanitizer with clang
- `-Dreporting=ON` to build code necessary for reporting mode (defaults to OFF)


## How to add a dependency

If you want to experiment with a new package, here are the steps to get it
working:

1. Search for the package on [Conan Center](https://conan.io/center/).
1. In [`conanfile.py`](./conanfile.py):
    1. Add a version of the package to the `requires` property.
    1. Change any default options for the package by adding them to the
    `default_options` property (with syntax `'$package:$option': $value`)
1. In [`CMakeLists.txt`](./CMakeLists.txt):
    1. Add a call to `find_package($package REQUIRED)`.
    1. Link a library from the package to the target `ripple_libs` (search for
    the existing call to `target_link_libraries(ripple_libs INTERFACE ...)`).
1. Start coding! Don't forget to include whatever headers you need from the
   package.
